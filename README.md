## Installation

Ensure your version of python is up to date or newer than
- Python 3.11.9


### Cloning from git

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/george-taylor03/Many-Particle-System-in-the-Plane.git
cd Many-Particle-System-in-the-Plane
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Manual install of libraries

>[!NOTE]
> We recommend using an environment and installing dependencies using
> ```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```
> [See above](https://github.com/george-taylor03/Many-Particle-System-in-the-Plane?tab=readme-ov-file#cloning-from-git)

However the required libraries can be installed individually
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install numba
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
```

## Usage
For Task 1 see `SimulationStep.py`

For Task 2 see `Fluctuations.py`

For Task 3 see `runCompression.py`

For Task 4 see `Gravity.py`

### `SimulationStep.py`

Contains the function SimulationStep that preforms one single step forward in time.

- Args:
    - dt (float): Time step size
    - x (2xN array): Current particle positions (first row are horizontal coordinates, second row are vertical coordinates)
    - v (2xN array): Current particle velocities (first row are horizontal coordinates, second row are vertical coordinates)
    - part (dictionary['radius','spring']): Stores properties of the particle (radius r of all particles and spring constant of all particles)
    - box (2x2 array): Array storing the corners of the box (np.vstack([low,upp]))
    - g (float): Single number, the amount g of gravity

- Returns:
    - tuple: 
        - xnew(2xN array): updated position
        - vnew(2xN array): updated velocity
        - forces_walls(length 4 array): Force exerted on each wall at that moment in the order [left, right, bottom, top]
        - distance(length N array): Distance travelled by each particle during the timestep
        - wall_collision_particles(length N array): Of boolean variables where True shows a particle is in range of a collision with a wall
        - particle_collision_particles(set of variable length): Each element is a tuple which holds the index of the particle and its colliding particle. Only pairs of colliding particles appear in the set
        - v_walls(length N array); The individual horizontal wall force experienced by each particle

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This file does nothing when run. The function needs to be imported into other files.

### `Fluctuations.py`
This file is for Task 2 (T2)

At the start there are 3 variables that can switched from `True` to `False` depending on which part of the question you want to run. All can be `True` at the same time.

|Part|Usage|
|----|-----|
|`partA`|Plots a loglog plot of number of particles against standard deviation of temperature|
|`partB`|Plots a histogram of the distribution of particle speeds|
|`partC`|Prints the value of the mean free path|

Run using:
```bash
python ./Fluctuations.py
```
### `runCompression.py`

This file is for Task 3 (T3)

Shows the compression animation live

> [!CAUTION]
> The animation takes a couple of minutes to run

Prints:
- Initial average pressure
- Compressed average pressure
- Compressed average temperature

Plots temperature over time for the predetermined time frame

Plots average pressure over time for the same predetermined time frame

Run using:
```bash
python ./runCompression.py
```

### `Gravity.py`

This file is for Task 4 (T4)

#### It shows 4 graphs in total:
- A plot of density against y level
- A plot of temperature against y level
- A plot of pressure on the **left** wall against y level
- A plot of pressure on the **right** wall against y level

Run using:
```bash
python ./Gravity.py
```
